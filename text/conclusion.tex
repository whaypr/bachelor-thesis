\chapter{Conclusion}
%---------------------------------------------------------------

In this thesis we introduced the reader to the topic of covert networks and their analysis,
with emphasis on the \HL problem which we described, motivated its study
and for which we provided an overview of results from the literature.
We pointed out there are multiple definition of the problem in the literature and described our motivation
for picking one,
we then reviewed some of the results from the literature with repsect to this definition.
The results from the literature are described in a language of classical complexity theory,
so we put them into a perspective of the parameterized complexity framework, which we also briefly introduced.
Then, we focused on the problem with respect to the degree centrality measure
and presented our own parameterized complexity results in this domain.
Last, we put together both our results and results from the literature for the degree centrality
and visualize them in an overviewing graph.

Some of the future work may involve revision of more proofs from the literature with respect to our definition,
or inspecting the problem with different sets of parameters in consideration.
To this end, a parameter for which \HL may admit an FPT algorithm in some cases seems to be a \emph{mininum vertex cover}.
