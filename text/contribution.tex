\section{Proofs revision}\label{sec:proofRevs}

Waniek et al. \cite{Waniek2017} proposed three hardness results for the \HL problem given degree, closeness and betweenness
centralities. In this section, we review the first aforementioned result with respect to our definition of \HLshort.

% Theorem - degree
\begin{theorem}
    The \HL problem is NP-complete given the degree centrality.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    \itshape{``
    \todo{change} The problem is trivially in NP, since after the addition of a given [|W|] it is possible to
    compute the degree centrality for all nodes in polynomial time.
    
    Next, we prove that the problem is NP-hard. To this end, we propose a reduction from the NP-complete problem of Finding k-clique.
    The decision version of this problem is defined by a network,
    $G = (V , E)$, and a constant, $k \in \mathbb{N}$, where the goal is to determine whether there exist $k$ nodes in $G$ that form a clique.
    
    Let us assume that $k \geq 3$ (if $k = 2$ then the problem is trivial). Given an instance of the problem
    of Finding k-clique, defined by some $k \geq 3$ and a network $G = (V , E)$, let us construct a network,
    $H = (V', E')$, as follows:
    
    \begin{description}
        \item[The set of nodes:] For every node, $v_i \in V$, we create a single node, $v_i$ , as well as $|N_G(v_i)|$
        other nodes, denoted by $X = \{x_{i,1},\dots, x{i,|N_G(v_i)|} \}$. Additionally, we create one node called $y$,
        as well as $\boldsymbol{n + k}$ other nodes, namely, $L' = l_1,\dots, \boldsymbol{l_{n+k}}$;
        \item[The set of edges:] We create an edge between two nodes $v_i, v_k \in V$ if and only if this edge
        was not present in $G$, i.e., $(v_i, v_j ) \in E' \Leftrightarrow (v_i, v_j ) \notin E$.
        Additionally, for every $v_i$ , we create an edge $(v_i , y)$ as well as an edge $(v_i, x_i, j)$ for every $x_i, j$.
        We also create an edge $(l_i, l_j)$ between every pair of nodes $l_i, l_j \in L'$, except for the edge $(l_1, l_2)$.
        Finally, we create two additional edges, $(l_1, y)$ and $(l_2, y)$.
    \end{description}

    An example of such an $H$ network is illustrated in [figure ommited]. Now, consider the following instance
    of the problem of hiding leaders, $(H, L, b, c, [d] )$, where:

    \begin{description}
        \item $H = (V', E')$ is the network we just constructed;
        \item $L = V' \setminus V$;
        \item $b = \frac{k\cdot(k-1)}{2}$;
        \item $c$ is the degree centrality measure;
        \item $[d] = k$. 
    \end{description}

    Next, we reduce the problem of Finding k-cliques in $G$ to the aforementioned instance of Hiding
    Leaders in $H$ . To this end, from the definition of the problem of Hiding Leaders, we know that the
    edges to be added to $H$ must be chosen from $F \times F$. Since in our instance we have:
    $F = V' \setminus L = V' \setminus (V' \setminus V ) = V$, then the edges to be added to $H$ must be chosen
    from $V \times V$ . However, since the edges in $(V \times V ) \setminus E$ are already present in $H$
    (see how $H$ is created), then the edges to be added to $H$ must be chosen from $E$.
    Out of those edges, we need to choose a subset, $[W] \subseteq E$, as a solution to the problem.
    In what follows, we will show that a solution to the above instance of the problem of \HL in $H$ corresponds
    to a solution to the problem of Finding k-clique in $G$.

    First, note that each of the k nodes with the highest degree centrality in $H$ must be a member of
    $L'$. This is because there are more than k nodes in $L'$, each of which has a degree of $\boldsymbol{n+k-1}$, while
    the degree of every node in $V' \setminus L'$ is smaller than $\boldsymbol{n + k - 1}$. Thus, for $[W]$
    to be a solution to the problem of hiding leaders, the addition of $[W]$ to $H$ must increase
    the degree of at least $k$ nodes in $V$ such that each of them has a degree of at least $n + k - 1$
    (note that the addition of $[W]$ only increases the degrees of nodes in $V$, as we already established
    that $[W] \subseteq E$). Now, since in $H$ the degree of every node in $V$ equals $n$
    (because of the way $H$ is created), then to increase the degree of $k$ such nodes to $n + k - 1$, each of them
    must be an end of at least $k - 1$ edges in $[W]$. But, since the budget in our problem instance is
    $\frac{k\cdot(k-1)}{2}$, then the only possible choice of $[W]$ is the one that increases the
    degree of exactly $k$ nodes in $V$ by exactly $k - 1$. If such a choice of $[W]$ is available, then surely
    those $k$ nodes would form a clique in $G$, since all $\frac{k\cdot(k-1)}{2}$ edges in $[W]$ are taken from $G$.

\section{Our results}

The next proof is built on the same idea Waniek et al. \cite{Waniek2017} presented in their proof of
NP-completeness of \HLshort for the degree centrality measure.
The core idea of the proof is that we construct a network in such way that finding a solution $W$ of the \HL problem
correspond to finding a solution of the problem we started with, essentially having the starting network
present in the constructed network in some manner and then finding a solution inside of it.

\begin{theorem}
    \HL parameterized by $b + d$ is W[1]-hard even if $|L| = 1$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}\label{proofDB}
    To proof this theorem, we propose a parameterized reduction from the $k$-\textsc{Clique} problem on regular graphs,
    which is known to be W[1]-hard with respect to $k$ \cite{Mathieson2008}.
    
    Suppose we have a parameterized $k$-\textsc{Clique} instance $(G, k)$, where $|V(G)|=n$, $G$ is a $r$-regular graph and $n-2 \geq r \geq k \geq 3$
    (for $r > n-2$ or $r < k$ or $k < 3$ the problem is trivial).
    Then, we construct a graph $H$ in the following way:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Start with an empty graph $H$.
        \item Add all vertices from $G$, i.e., $V(H) \leftarrow V(G)$, mark these vertices as $F_1$.
        \item Add all edges from $\overline{G}$, i.e., $E(H) \leftarrow E(\overline{G})$.
        \item Add an extra vertex $\ell$, i.e., $V(H) \leftarrow V(H) \cup \{\ell\}$.
        \item Add an edge between vertex $\ell$ and $n - r + (k - 1) \eqqcolon \lambda$ arbitrarily chosen vertices $X \subset F_1$,
              i.e., $E(H) \leftarrow E(H) \cup \{ (\ell, x) \mid x \in X \}$.
        \item For each vertex $v \in V(H) \setminus X \eqqcolon Y$, introduce a new vertex $w_v$ and add edge $\{v, w_v\}$, i.e.,
              $V(H) \leftarrow V(H) \cup \{ w_v \mid v \in Y \}$ and $E(H) \leftarrow E(H) \cup \{ (v, w_v) \mid v \in Y \}$,
              mark set of $w_v$ for each $v \in Y$ as $F_2$.
    \end{enumerate}
    An example of such construction can be seen in figure \ref{fig:proofDB}.

    Note that step 5 can always be done because $r \ge k$, so $|F_1| = n > n - r + (k - 1)$
    and since $deg(l) = 0$ (before step 5), there are enough vertices for $\ell$ to connect with.
    Considering $G$ is $r$-regular, its complement, constructed and added into $H$ in steps 2 and 3, must be $(n-r-1)$-regular.
    After connecting all the $F_1$ vertices either with $\ell$, or the corresponding $w_v$ in steps 5 and 6,
    they all end up with degree $n-r$; in other words, graph $H[F_1]$ is $(n-r)$-regular.
    Also note that the construction of $H$ is done in time polynomial to $n$.
    Now we show how finding a $k$-clique in graph $G$ corresponds to finding a solution $W$ of \HLshort in $H$.

    Let us take $ \mathcal{I} = (H, \{\ell\}, \frac{k\cdot(k-1)}{2}, c, k)$, where $c$ is a degree centrality measure,
    as an instance of \HLshort with $k' \coloneqq b + d = \frac{k\cdot(k-1)}{2} + k$ as a parameter.
    First we note that degree of the only leader $\ell$ is $\lambda$, as presented above.
    The other vertices $V(H) - l$ are naturally followers of which we can recognize two types, $F_1$ and $F_2$,
    where $\forall_{f_1 \in F_1} deg(f_1)$ = $n-r$ and $\forall_{f_2 \in F_2} deg(f_2)$ = $1$.
    Whereas $F_1$ are vertices of the original graph $G$,
    $F_2$ plays a role of ``partners'' of vertices $Y$, since their only job is to substitute a missing connection with $\ell$.

    Because we just have one leader in $\mathcal{I}$, it is clear that for any follower $f' \in F'$ applies that
    $deg(f') \geq \lambda = n - r + (k - 1)$.
    Also, because $n > r$, $\max\limits_{\forall f_1 \in F_1}deg(f_1) = n-r > 1 = \max\limits_{\forall f_2 \in F_2}deg(f_2)$.
    With this in mind, we state the following:

    \begin{lemma}\label{lemmaInProof}
        No $F'$ can contain vertex from $F_2$, i.e., $F' \cap F_2 = \emptyset$.
    \end{lemma}
    \begin{subproof}
        Assume $F' \subseteq F_1$. This is a valid assumption because $|F_1| = n > k$ and it must be at least $d = k$ vertices in $F'$.
        Because all vertices from $F_1$ have degree $n-r$, we must have added at least $\lambda - (n - r) = k - 1$ new neighbours to all vertices from $F'$.
        Since the budget $b$ in $\mathcal{I}$ is $\frac{k\cdot(k-1)}{2}$,
        the only possible way of how $F'$ could have been constructed is that $|F'|=k$ and the newly added edges $W \subset F_1 \times F_1$, $|W| = b$
        connect all the $k$ vertices $f' \in F'$ in a way that graph $(F', W)$ forms a $k$-clique.
        From this and from the statements above, we can see that no vertex from $F_2$ can be in $F'$
        since there will never be large enough budget $b$ to let us reach the safety margin $d$.
    \end{subproof}

    As shown in the proof of lemma \ref{lemmaInProof}, every feasible solution $W$ of \HLshort for instance $\mathcal{I}$, together with corresponding $F'$,
    will form a $k$-clique.
    Note that every edge from $W$ must be an edge from the original graph $G$ because $W \subset F_1 \times F_1$ and $F_1 = E(G)$
    and also all the edges from $E(\overline{G})$ are already in $E(H)$ so they cannot be in $W$ since it only contains newly added edges.

    Because a solution $W$ for \HLshort in $H$ exists if and only if a $k$-clique in $G$ exists,
    we can conclude that finding a solution for the \HL problem in graph $H$ is exactly the same as
    finding a solution for the $k$-\textsc{Clique} problem in graph $G$.

    The reduction presented in this proof is a valid parameterized reduction because;
    $(G, k)$ is a yes-instance of the $k$-\textsc{Clique} problem if and only if $\mathcal{I}$ is a yes-instance of \HLshort;
    the construction of $H$ is done in time polynomial to $n$;
    and there is a function of $k$, $g(k) = \frac{k\cdot(k-1)}{2} + k$, upper-bounding the parameter $k'$ of $\mathcal{I}$.
\end{proof}

% Corollary
Because we have just shown there is the reduction from the $k$-\textsc{Clique} problem on regular graphs to the
\HL problem with a constant number of leaders and because this reduction is done in polynomial time,
we directly get this corollary.

\begin{corollary}
    \HL is para-NP-hard with respect to $|L|$.
\end{corollary}
