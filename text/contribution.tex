%---------------------------------------------------------------

This is the main chapter of the thesis.
On this place, we present our contribution to the topic of the \HL problem.
We first review a proof of a theorem about \HLdeg from Waniek et al. \cite{Waniek2017} and show
its correctness for our definition of \HL.
Then, we present our own proofs for \HLshort regarding various parameters and complexity classes.
Lastly, we put our results in the context of the work of other authors,
visualizing all the parameterized complexity results for \HLdeg discovered to date.

\section{Proof revision}\label{section:proofRevision}

Waniek et al. \cite{Waniek2017} proposed three hardness results for the \HL problem given degree, closeness and betweenness
centralities. In this section, we review the first aforementioned result with respect to our definition of \HLshort.
The original theorem reads: \emph{``The \HL problem is \NPc given the degree centrality.''}.
The proof adjustments are pretty straightforward but to better understand them,
let us first briefly describe the idea of that proof.

A common way of proving \NP-hardness is to propose a polynomial reduction from another \NPh problem to the
problem we are proving \NP-hardness of.
In this proof, the authors show a reduction from the $k$-\textsc{Clique} problem defined on graph $G$.
The idea is following: In a polynomial time, construct a new graph $H$ from $G$ in a way that
in order to solve \HL in $H$ we must solve $k$-\textsc{Clique} in $G$ in the first place.
To achieve that, the authors, as a starting point of $H$, first create a complement of $G$ 
where all vertices are marked as followers. This will be the only followers in final $H$.
This initial construction assures that every possible solution of \HLshort will only consists of edges from $G$, i.e.,
$W \subseteq E(G)$ (and $F' \subseteq V(G)$).
Next, they add two types of leaders into $H$, each type with a different purpose.
Leaders of the first type act like ``regularizators'' as their only job is to connect with followers (in some way) and,
by doing so, make degree of every follower the same and equal to $n$.
These leaders are denoted as $X$ and $y$ in the original proof.
The task of the second type, having no connection with followers at all,
is then to set a maximum degree across all leaders, which followers from $F'$ will have to reach.
These leaders are denoted as $L'$ and are practically the only concern of our adjustments to which we now proceed.

We allow equality of centralities between followers from $F'$ and leaders in our definition of \HL.
To compensate it, we just need to create one extra leader of the second type, that is,
$|L'| = n+k$ as opposed of $|L'| = n+k-1$ in the original proof,
leading to all leaders from $L'$ having degree of $n+k-1$, as opposed of $n+k-2$ in the original proof.
Now note that this is the highest degree among the leaders and that all the followers have degree $n$,
so, in order to be part of $F'$, they must obtain at least $(n+k-1) - n = k-1$ new neighbors.
We got into exactly the same situation as in the original proof and since, as stated above,
leaders from $L'$ do not have any other purpose than setting the maximum degree of all leaders,
the rest of the arguments presented in the proof remain unchanged.

We have just shown that allowing equality of centralities between followers from $F'$ and leaders does not
break the proof presented by Waniek et al. \cite{Waniek2017}.
The other change in our definition of \HL is that we allow all members to be leaders, $L = V$,
but since such instances are trivial as they are $yes$-instances if and only if $d = 0$,
there is nothing to change in the proof.


%---------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Our results}

The next proof is built on the same idea Waniek et al. \cite{Waniek2017} presented in their proof of
\NP-completeness of \HLshort for the degree centrality measure.
We reviewed the proof from Waniek et al. and its core ideas in Section \ref{section:proofRevision}.
We present a proof of a stronger theorem, with simpler reduction graph and in the language of parameterized complexity.
These results are possible mainly because of a stronger assumption in the proof where we assume a regular graph as the input.

The core idea of the proof is that we construct a network in such way that finding a solution $W$ of the \HL problem
correspond to finding a solution of the problem we started with, essentially having the starting network
present in the constructed network in some manner and then finding a solution inside of it.

\begin{theorem}
    \HL parameterized by $b + d$ is \Wh even if $|L| = 1$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}\label{proofDB}
    To proof this theorem, we propose a parameterized reduction from the $k$-\textsc{Clique} problem on regular graphs,
    which is known to be \Wh with respect to $k$ \cite{Mathieson2008}.
    
    Suppose we have a parameterized $k$-\textsc{Clique} instance $(G, k)$, where $|V(G)|=n$, $G$ is a $r$-regular graph and $n-2 \geq r \geq k \geq 3$
    (for $r > n-2$ or $r < k$ or $k < 3$ the problem is trivial).
    Then, we construct a graph $H$ in the following way:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Start with an empty graph $H$.
        \item Add all vertices from $G$, i.e., $V(H) \leftarrow V(G)$, mark these vertices as $F_1$.
        \item Add all edges from $\overline{G}$, i.e., $E(H) \leftarrow E(\overline{G})$.
        \item Add an extra vertex $\ell$, i.e., $V(H) \leftarrow V(H) \cup \{\ell\}$.
        \item Add an edge between vertex $\ell$ and $n - r + (k - 1) = \lambda$ arbitrarily chosen vertices $X \subset F_1$,
              i.e., $E(H) \leftarrow E(H) \cup \{ (\ell, x) \mid x \in X \}$.
        \item For each vertex $v \in V(H) \setminus X \eqqcolon Y$, introduce a new vertex $w_v$ and add edge $\{v, w_v\}$, i.e.,
              $V(H) \leftarrow V(H) \cup \{ w_v \mid v \in Y \}$ and $E(H) \leftarrow E(H) \cup \{ (v, w_v) \mid v \in Y \}$,
              mark the set of $w_v$ for each $v \in Y$ as $F_2$.
    \end{enumerate}
    An example of such construction can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:proofDB}.

    Note that step 5 can always be done because $r \ge k$, so $|F_1| = n > n - r + (k - 1)$
    and since $deg(l) = 0$ (before step 5), there are enough vertices for $\ell$ to connect with.
    Considering $G$ is $r$-regular, its complement, constructed and added into $H$ in steps 2 and 3, must be $(n-r-1)$-regular.
    After connecting all the $F_1$ vertices either with $\ell$, or the corresponding $w_v$ in steps 5 and 6,
    they all end up with degree $n-r$; in other words, graph $H[F_1]$ is $(n-r)$-regular.
    Also note that the construction of $H$ is done in time polynomial to $n$.
    Now we show how finding a $k$-clique in graph $G$ corresponds to finding a solution $W$ of \HLshort in $H$.

    Let us take $\mathcal{I} = (H, \{\ell\}, \frac{k\cdot(k-1)}{2}, c, k)$, where $c$ is a degree centrality measure,
    as an instance of \HLdeg with $k' \coloneqq b + d = \frac{k\cdot(k-1)}{2} + k$ as a parameter.
    First we note that degree of the only leader $\ell$ is $\lambda$, as presented above.
    The other vertices $V(H) - l$ are naturally followers of which we can recognize two types, $F_1$ and $F_2$,
    where $\forall_{f_1 \in F_1} deg(f_1)$ = $n-r$ and $\forall_{f_2 \in F_2} deg(f_2)$ = $1$.
    Whereas $F_1$ are vertices of the original graph $G$,
    $F_2$ plays a role of ``partners'' of vertices $Y$, since their only job is to substitute a missing connection with $\ell$.

    Because we just have one leader in $\mathcal{I}$, it is clear that for any follower $f' \in F'$ applies that
    $deg(f') \geq \lambda = n - r + (k - 1)$.
    Also, because $n > r$, $\max\limits_{\forall f_1 \in F_1}deg(f_1) = n-r > 1 = \max\limits_{\forall f_2 \in F_2}deg(f_2)$.
    With this in mind, we state the following:

    \begin{lemma}\label{lemmaInProof}
        No $F'$ can contain vertex from $F_2$, i.e., $F' \cap F_2 = \emptyset$.
    \end{lemma}
    \begin{subproof}
        Assume $F' \subseteq F_1$. This is a valid assumption because $|F_1| = n > k$ and it must be at least $d = k$ vertices in $F'$.
        Because all vertices from $F_1$ have degree $n-r$, we must have added at least $\lambda - (n - r) = k - 1$ new neighbors to all vertices from $F'$.
        Since the budget $b$ in $\mathcal{I}$ is $\frac{k\cdot(k-1)}{2}$,
        the only possible way of how $F'$ could have been constructed is that $|F'|=k$ and the newly added edges $W \subset F_1 \times F_1$, $|W| = b$
        connect all the $k$ vertices $f' \in F'$ in a way that graph $(F', W)$ forms a $k$-clique.
        From this and from the statements above, we can see that no vertex from $F_2$ can be in $F'$
        since there will never be large enough budget $b$ to let us reach the safety margin $d$.
    \end{subproof}

    As shown in the proof of Lemma \ref{lemmaInProof}, every feasible solution $W$ of \HLshort for instance $\mathcal{I}$, together with corresponding $F'$,
    will form a $k$-clique.
    Note that every edge from $W$ must be an edge from the original graph $G$ because $W \subset F_1 \times F_1$ and $F_1 = E(G)$
    and also all the edges from $E(\overline{G})$ are already in $E(H)$ so they cannot be in $W$ since it only contains newly added edges.

    Because a solution $W$ for \HLshort in $H$ exists if and only if a $k$-clique in $G$ exists,
    we can conclude that finding a solution for the \HL problem in graph $H$ is exactly the same as
    finding a solution for the $k$-\textsc{Clique} problem in graph $G$.

    The reduction presented in this proof is a valid parameterized reduction because;
    $(G, k)$ is a yes-instance of the $k$-\textsc{Clique} problem if and only if $\mathcal{I}$ is a yes-instance of \HLdeg;
    the construction of $H$ is done in time polynomial to $n$;
    and there is a function of $k$, $g(k) = \frac{k\cdot(k-1)}{2} + k$, upper-bounding the parameter $k'$ of $\mathcal{I}$.

% Corollary
Because we have just shown there is a parameterized reduction from the $k$-\textsc{Clique} problem on regular graphs to the
\HL problem with a constant number of leaders and because this reduction is done in polynomial time,
we directly get this corollary.

\begin{corollary}
    \HL is \pNPh with respect to $|L|$.
\end{corollary}
This means that we cannot hope for a FPT algorithm for the \HL problem with respect to any possible parameter. 


% XP algo for param d
Let us now look at the problem from the opposite end.
We will show that \HL parameterized whether by budget $b$ or by safety margin $d$ is XP.
We present a proof of the variant with parameter $d$ first.

\begin{theorem}
    \HL parameterized by $d$ is XP.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    Given parameterized instance $(\mathcal{I}, d)$, where $\mathcal{I} = (G, L, b, c, d)$ is a \HLdeg instance and $d$ is the parameter,
    we show an algorithm which decides whether or not $(\mathcal{I}, d)$ is a $yes$-instance in time bounded by
    $f(d) \cdot |(\mathcal{I}, d)|^{g(d)}$ for some computable functions $f,g$.

    We start by picking gradually each of the $\binom{|F|}{d} = \Theta(|V(G)|^d)$ $d$-element subsets of followers $F$,
    we denote the current subset as $D$ and a set of edges that can be added between followers from $D$
    as $\hat{A}_D \subseteq \hat{A}$, $\hat{A}_D = E(\overline{G[D]})$.
    Because we take all the possible $d$-element subsets of $F$, we eventually find a subset $D$ such that,
    after addition of new edges, $D = F'$,
    if $F'$ exists, i.e., if $(\mathcal{I}, d)$ is a $yes$-instance.
    Then, we try to add $min(|\hat{A}_D|, b) \coloneqq t$ edges between followers from $D$ in each of the $\binom{d}{t} \leq 2^d$ possible ways.
    Note that $t$ can be $b$ because we are not allowed to add more than $b$ edges into $G$.
    From now, only these three situations can occur:

    First, we added $t$ edges into $G$ and all $D$ vertices have degree greater than $\lambda$.
    Because $|D| = d$, $(\mathcal{I}, d)$ is a $yes$-instance.
    We can check this in time $\mathcal{O}(|V(G)|)$.
    
    Second, we added $t$ edges into $G$ but not all $D$ vertices have degree greater than $\lambda$.
    Moreover, $|\hat{A}_D| < b$ and thus we know that $G[D]$ is (after adding new edges) already a complete graph
    but we still can add some edges into $G$ before reaching the budget $b$. 
    In this situation $D = F'$ if and only if there is at least $min_{\delta \in D}\{deg(\delta)\}$ followers
    outside of $D$ and a number of edges we are still allowed to add before reaching budget $b$, $b - |\hat{A}_D|$,
    is smaller than the sum of connections needed to reach $\lambda$ of all vertices from $D$,
    $\sum_{\delta \in D} min(0, \lambda - deg(\delta))$.
    This is true because in order for instance $(\mathcal{I}, d)$ to be a $yes$-instance, we must
    ensure that each follower from $D$ has degree at least $\lambda$, for what we connect them to some followers
    outside $D$ (becuase $D$ is already complete), for which there must be enough followers outside $D$ and
    we must have enough edges left before reaching $b$.
    Note that if $D = F'$, then $(\mathcal{I}, d)$ in a $yes$-instance.
    
    Third, we added $t$ edges into $G$ but not all $D$ vertices have degree greater than $\lambda$.
    Moreover, $|\hat{A}_D| \geq b$ so $t = b$ and $D \neq F'$.
    We can check this in time $\mathcal{O}(|V(G)|)$.

    Situation other than one of the three cannot occur.
    If instance $(\mathcal{I}, d)$ is not identified as a $yes$-instance for any choice of $D$,
    then we conclude that $(\mathcal{I}, d)$ is a $no$-instance because if it was a $yes$-instance,
    then we would have found it by the procedure above.
    
    The algorithm we have just described runs in time $f(d) \cdot |(\mathcal{I}, d)|^{g(d)}$ for $f(d) = 2^d$ and $g(d) = d$
    and where the instance size $|(\mathcal{I}, d)|$ is measured as $|V(G)|$.
    From this we can conclude that \HL parameterized by $d$ is XP.
\end{proof}

Notice that although the just presented algorithm is not possibly the best one we could find,
it surely belongs to the best possible complexity class, \XP, because as we already know,
there can be no FPT algorithm for \HL. 


% XP algo for param b
Now we proceed to a proof of the variant with parameter $b$.

\begin{theorem}
    \HL parameterized by $b$ is XP.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    Given parameterized problem $(\mathcal{I} b)$, where $x = (G, L, b, c, d)$ is a \HLdeg instance and $b$ is the parameter,
    we show an algorithm which decides whether or not $(\mathcal{I} b)$ is a $yes$-instance in time bounded by
    $f(b) \cdot |(\mathcal{I} b)|^{g(b)}$ for some computable functions $f,g$.

    We try to find a solution by a brute-force.
    Let us use symbol $\hat{A}$ to denote a set of edges between followers that are not present in $G$ and
    thus can be added, $\hat{A} = \overline{G[F]}$.
    The idea is that \todo{todo}

        The complexity picture for \HDGshort for both Nash and individual stability.
        Combinations of parameters which give rise to fixed-parameter algorithms are highlighted in green,
        while combinations for which \HDGshort is \Wh but in \XP are highlighted in orange and \NPc combinations
        are highlighted in red.
        Results explicitly proved in this work are represented by a black box and a reference to the given theorem,
        corollary or lemma.
