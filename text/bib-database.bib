  abstract = {Centrality measures are widely used to identify leaders of covert networks. We study how a group of such leaders can avoid being detected by such measures. More concretely, we study the hardness of choosing a set of edges that can be added to the network in order to decrease the leaders' ranking according to two fundamental centrality measures, namely degree, and closeness. We prove that this problem is NP-complete for each measure. We then study how the leaders can construct a network from scratch, designed specifically for them to hide in disguise. We identify a network structure that not only guarantees to hide the leaders to a certain extent, but also allows them to spread their influence across the network.},

  abstract = {Covert networks are social networks that often consist of harmful users. Social Network Analysis (SNA) has played an important role in reducing criminal activities (e.g., counter terrorism) via detecting the influential users in such networks. There are various popular measures to quantify how influential or central any vertex is in a network. As expected, strategic and influential miscreants in covert networks would try to hide herself and her partners (called em leaders ) from being detected via these measures by introducing new edges. Waniek et al. show that the corresponding computational problem, called Hiding Leader, is NP Complete for the degree and closeness centrality measures. We study the popular core centrality measure and show that the problem is NP Complete even when the core centrality of every leader is only 3. On the contrary, we prove that the problem becomes polynomial time solvable for the degree centrality measure if the degree of every leader is bounded above by any constant. We then focus on the optimization version of the problem and show that the Hiding Leader problem admits a 2 factor approximation algorithm for the degree centrality measure. We complement it by proving that one cannot hope to have any (2-epsilon) factor approximation algorithm for any constant $epsilon&gt;0$ unless there is a epsilon/2 factor polynomial time algorithm for the Densest k-Subgraph problem which would be considered a significant breakthrough. We empirically establish that our 2 factor approximation algorithm frequently finds out a near optimal solution. On the contrary, for the core centrality measure, we show that the Hiding Leader problem does not admit any (1-alpha) ln n factor approximation algorithm for any constant alpha in (0,1) unless P=NP even when the core centrality of every leader is only 3. Hence, our work shows that, although classical complexity theoretic framework fails to shed any light on relative difficulty of Hiding Leader for different centrality measures, the problem is significantly "harder'' for the core centrality measure than the degree centrality one.},

  abstract = {Node similarity measures quantify how similar a pair of nodes are in a network. These similarity measures turn out to be an important fundamental tool for many real world applications such as link prediction in networks, recommender systems etc. An important class of similarity measures are local similarity measures. Two nodes are considered similar under local similarity measures if they have large overlap between their neighboring set of nodes. Manipulating node similarity measures via removing edges is an important problem. This type of manipulation, for example, hinders effectiveness of link prediction in terrorists networks. All the popular computational problems formulated around manipulating similarity measures turn out to be NP-hard. We, in this paper, provide fine grained complexity results of these problems through the lens of parameterized complexity. In particular, we show that some of these problems are fixed parameter tractable (FPT) with respect to various natural parameters whereas other problems remain intractable (W[1]-hard and W[2]-hard in particular). Finally we show the effectiveness of our proposed FPT algorithms on real world datasets as well as synthetic networks generated using Barabasi-Albert and Erdos-Renyi models.},

  abstract = {We study variants and generalizations of the problem of finding an r-regular subgraph (where r ≤ 3) in a given graph by deleting at most k vertices. Moser and Thilikos (2006) have shown that the problem is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) if parameterized by (k, r). They asked whether the problem remains fixed-parameter tractable if parameterized by k alone. We answer this question negatively: we show that if parameterized by k alone the problem is W[1]-hard and therefore very unlikely fixed-parameter tractable. We also give W[1]-hardness results for variants of the problem where the parameter is the number of vertex and edge deletions allowed, and for a new generalized form of the problem where the obtained subgraph is not necessarily regular but its vertices have certain prescribed degrees. Following this we demonstrate fixed-parameter tractability for the considered problems if the parameter includes the regularity r or an upper bound on the prescribed degrees in the generalized form of the problem. These FPT results are obtained via kernelization, so also provide a practical approach to the problems presented.},
