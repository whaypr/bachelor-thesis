  abstract = {Centrality measures are the most commonly advocated social network analysis tools for identifying leaders of covert organizations. While the literature has predominantly focused on studying the effectiveness of existing centrality measures or developing new ones, we study the problem from the opposite perspective, by focusing on how a group of leaders can avoid being identified by centrality measures as key members of a covert network. More specifically, we analyze the problem of choosing a set of edges to be added to a network to decrease the leaders’ ranking according to three fundamental centrality measures, namely, degree, closeness, and betweenness. We prove that this problem is NP-complete for each measure. Moreover, we study how the leaders can construct a network from scratch, designed specifically to keep them hidden from centrality measures. We identify a network structure that not only guarantees to hide the leaders to a certain extent but also allows them to spread their influence across the network.},

  abstract = {Covert networks are social networks that often consist of harmful users. Social Network Analysis (SNA) has played an important role in reducing criminal activities (e.g., counter terrorism) via detecting the influential users in such networks. There are various popular measures to quantify how influential or central any vertex is in a network. As expected, strategic and influential miscreants in covert networks would try to hide herself and her partners (called em leaders ) from being detected via these measures by introducing new edges. Waniek et al. show that the corresponding computational problem, called Hiding Leader, is NP Complete for the degree and closeness centrality measures. We study the popular core centrality measure and show that the problem is NP Complete even when the core centrality of every leader is only 3. On the contrary, we prove that the problem becomes polynomial time solvable for the degree centrality measure if the degree of every leader is bounded above by any constant. We then focus on the optimization version of the problem and show that the Hiding Leader problem admits a 2 factor approximation algorithm for the degree centrality measure. We complement it by proving that one cannot hope to have any (2-epsilon) factor approximation algorithm for any constant $epsilon&gt;0$ unless there is a epsilon/2 factor polynomial time algorithm for the Densest k-Subgraph problem which would be considered a significant breakthrough. We empirically establish that our 2 factor approximation algorithm frequently finds out a near optimal solution. On the contrary, for the core centrality measure, we show that the Hiding Leader problem does not admit any (1-alpha) ln n factor approximation algorithm for any constant alpha in (0,1) unless P=NP even when the core centrality of every leader is only 3. Hence, our work shows that, although classical complexity theoretic framework fails to shed any light on relative difficulty of Hiding Leader for different centrality measures, the problem is significantly "harder'' for the core centrality measure than the degree centrality one.},

  abstract = {Node similarity measures quantify how similar a pair of nodes are in a network. These similarity measures turn out to be an important fundamental tool for many real world applications such as link prediction in networks, recommender systems etc. An important class of similarity measures are local similarity measures. Two nodes are considered similar under local similarity measures if they have large overlap between their neighboring set of nodes. Manipulating node similarity measures via removing edges is an important problem. This type of manipulation, for example, hinders effectiveness of link prediction in terrorists networks. All the popular computational problems formulated around manipulating similarity measures turn out to be NP-hard. We, in this paper, provide fine grained complexity results of these problems through the lens of parameterized complexity. In particular, we show that some of these problems are fixed parameter tractable (FPT) with respect to various natural parameters whereas other problems remain intractable (W[1]-hard and W[2]-hard in particular). Finally we show the effectiveness of our proposed FPT algorithms on real world datasets as well as synthetic networks generated using Barabasi-Albert and Erdos-Renyi models.},

  abstract = { For many fixed-parameter problems that are trivially soluable in polynomial time, such as \$(k\text{-})\$ DOMINATING SET, essentially no better algorithm is presently known than the one which tries all possible solutions. Other problems, such as \$(k\text{-})\$ FEEDBACK VERTEX SET, exhibit fixed-parameter tractability: for each fixed k the problem is soluable in time bounded by a polynomial of degree c, where c is a constant independent of k. We establish the main results of a completeness program which addresses the apparent fixed-parameter intractability of many parameterized problems. In particular, we define a hierarchy of classes of parameterized problems \$FPT \subseteq W[1] \subseteq W[2] \subseteq \cdots \subseteq W[SAT] \subseteq W [P]\$ and identify natural complete problems for \$W[t]\$ for \$t \geq 2\$. (In other papers we have shown many problems complete for \$W[1]\$.) DOMINATING SET is shown to be complete for \$W[2]\$, and thus is not fixed-parameter tractable unless INDEPENDENT SET, CLIQUE, IRREDUNDANT SET, and many other natural problems in \$W[2]\$ are also fixed-parameter tractable. We also give a compendium of currently known hardness results as an appendix. }

abstract = {A consistent trade-off facing participants in any criminal network is that between organizing for efficiency or security—participants collectively pursue an objective while keeping the action leading to that goal concealed. Which side of the trade-off is prioritized depends on the objective that is pursued by the criminal group. The distinction is most salient when comparing terrorist with criminal enterprise networks. Terrorist networks are ideologically driven, while criminal enterprises pursue monetary ends. Time-to-task is shorter in the criminal enterprise and group efficiency is therefore prioritized over group security. Terrorist networks, in contrast, have longer horizons and security is prioritized over the execution of any single attack. Using Krebs’ exploratory research on networks of terrorist cells and electronic surveillance transcripts of a drug importation network, our analyses demonstrate how these opposing trade-offs emerge in criminal group structures.}

abstract = {In order to be able to devise successful strategies for destabilizing covert organizations it is vital to recognize and understand their structural properties. Every covert organization faces the constant dilemma of staying secret and ensuring the necessary coordination between its members. Using elements from multi-objective optimization and bargaining game theory we analyze which communication structures are optimal in the sense of providing a balanced tradeoff between secrecy and operational efficiency. For several different secrecy and information scenarios this tradeoff is analyzed considering the set of connected graphs of given order as possible communication structures. Assuming uniform exposure probability of individuals in the network we show that the optimal communication structure corresponds to either a network with a central individual (the star graph) or an all-to-all network (the complete graph) depending on the link detection probability, which is the probability that communication between individuals will be detected. If the probability that an individual is exposed as member of the network depends on the information hierarchy determined by the structure of the graph, the optimal communication structure corresponds to a reinforced ring or wheel graph in case of an information measure based on average performance. In worst case performance with respect to information it can be seen that windmill wing graphs approximate optimal structures. Finally we give an example how optimal structures change when considering a non-balanced tradeoff between secrecy and operational efficiency.}

This is a difficult problem due to the very large number of elements in such networks, on the order of billions and higher, which makes it impossible to use conventional network analysis methods. Herein, we employ artificial intelligence (specifically swarm computing), to compute centrality metrics in a completely decentralized fashion. More exactly, we show that by overlaying a homogeneous artificial system (inspired by swarm intelligence) over a complex network (which is a heterogeneous system), and playing a game in the fused system, the changes in the homogeneous system will reflect perfectly the complex network properties. Our method, dubbed Game of Thieves (GOT), computes the importance of all network elements (both nodes and edges) in polylogarithmic time with respect to the total number of nodes. Contrary, the state-of-the-art methods need at least a quadratic time. Moreover, the excellent capabilities of our proposed approach, it terms of speed, accuracy, and functionality, open the path for better ways of understanding and controlling complex networks.}

The problem of detecting communities in large networks plays a key role in a wide range of research areas, e.g. Computer Science, Biology and Sociology. Most of the existing algorithms to find communities count on the topological features of the network and often do not scale well on large, real-life instances. In this article we propose a strategy to enhance existing community detection algorithms by adding a pre-processing step in which edges are weighted according to their centrality, w.r.t. the network topology. In our approach, the centrality of an edge reflects its contribute to making arbitrary graph transversals, i.e., spreading messages over the network, as short as possible. Our strategy is able to effectively complements information about network topology and it can be used as an additional tool to enhance community detection. The computation of edge centralities is carried out by performing multiple random walks of bounded length on the network. Our method makes the computation of edge centralities feasible also on large-scale networks. It has been tested in conjunction with three state-of-the-art community detection algorithms, namely the Louvain method, COPRA and OSLOM. Experimental results show that our method raises the accuracy of existing algorithms both on synthetic and real-life datasets.}

The importance of nodes and edges is formally described by a set of measures called centralities which are typically studied for graphs of small size. The proliferation of digital collection of data has led to huge graphs with billions of nodes and edges. For this reason, we focus on two new algorithms, Game of Thieves and WERW-Kpath which are computationally-light alternatives to the canonical centrality measures such as degree, node and edge betweenness, closeness and clustering. We explore the correlation among these measures using the Spearman's correlation coefficient on real criminal networks extracted from judicial documents of three Mafia operations.

  abstract = {We study variants and generalizations of the problem of finding an r-regular subgraph (where r ≤ 3) in a given graph by deleting at most k vertices. Moser and Thilikos (2006) have shown that the problem is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) if parameterized by (k, r). They asked whether the problem remains fixed-parameter tractable if parameterized by k alone. We answer this question negatively: we show that if parameterized by k alone the problem is W[1]-hard and therefore very unlikely fixed-parameter tractable. We also give W[1]-hardness results for variants of the problem where the parameter is the number of vertex and edge deletions allowed, and for a new generalized form of the problem where the obtained subgraph is not necessarily regular but its vertices have certain prescribed degrees. Following this we demonstrate fixed-parameter tractability for the considered problems if the parameter includes the regularity r or an upper bound on the prescribed degrees in the generalized form of the problem. These FPT results are obtained via kernelization, so also provide a practical approach to the problems presented.},

  ABSTRACT = {Covert networks refer to criminal organizations that operate outside the boundaries of the law; they can be mainly classified as terrorist networks and criminal networks. We consider how Social Network Analysis (SNA) is used to analyze such networks in order to attain a greater knowledge of criminal behavior. In fact, SNA allows examining the network structure and functioning by computing relevant metrics and parameters to identify roles, positions, features, and other network functioning that are not otherwise easily discovered at first glance. This is why Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) are showing growing interest in SNA, which is also used to identify weak spots and disrupt criminal groups. This paper provides a literature review and a classification of methods and real-case applications of disruption techniques. It considers covert network adaptability to such dismantling attempts, herein referred to as resilience. Critical problems of SNA in criminal studies are discussed, including data collection techniques and the inevitable incompleteness and biases of real-world datasets, with the aim of promoting a new research stream for both dismantling techniques and data collection issues.},

  abstract = {The identification of the most potentially hazardous agents in a terrorist organisation helps to prevent further attacks by effectively allocating surveillance resources and destabilising the covert network to which they belong. In this paper, several mechanisms for the overall ranking of covert networks members in a general framework are addressed based on their contribution to the overall relative effectiveness in the event of a merger. In addition, the possible organisation of agents outside of each possible merger naturally influences their relative effectiveness score, which motivates the innovative use of games in partition function form and specific ranking indices for individuals. Finally, we apply these methods to analyse the effectiveness of the hijackers of the covert network supporting the 9/11 attacks.}

Specifically, hypotheses are deduced from theoretical arguments regarding a ‘secrecy-efficiency trade off’ which is said to shape covert networks. The paper draws upon data concerning the UK suffragettes. It is taken from a publicly archived UK Home Office document listing 1992 court appearances (for suffrage related activities), involving 1214 individuals and 394 court sessions, between 1906 and 1914. Network structure at earlier phases of suffragette activism, when the movement was less covert, is compared with that during the final phase, when it was more covert and meets the definitional criteria of what we call a ‘covert social movement network’ (CSMN). Support for the various hypotheses tested is variable but the key claims derived from the idea of the secrecy-efficiency trade off are supported. Specifically, the suffragettes’ network becomes less dense and less degree centralised as it becomes more covert.}

  abstract={The application of Network Science to social systems has introduced new methodologies to analyze classical problems such as the emergence of epidemics, the arousal of cooperation between individuals or the propagation of information along social networks. More recently, the organization of football teams and their performance have been unveiled using metrics coming from Network Science, where a team is considered as a complex network whose nodes (i.e., players) interact with the aim of overcoming the opponent network. Here, we combine the use of different network metrics to extract the particular signature of the F.C. Barcelona coached by Guardiola, which has been considered one of the best teams along football history. We have first compared the network organization of Guardiola's team with their opponents along one season of the Spanish national league, identifying those metrics with statistically significant differences and relating them with the Guardiola's game. Next, we have focused on the temporal nature of football passing networks and calculated the evolution of all network properties along a match, instead of considering their average. In this way, we are able to identify those network metrics that enhance the probability of scoring/receiving a goal, showing that not all teams behave in the same way and how the organization Guardiola's F.C. Barcelona is different from the rest, including its clustering coefficient, shortest-path length, largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix, algebraic connectivity and centrality distribution.},

Having high closeness centrality can have positive impact on the vertex itself: hence, in this paper we consider the optimization problem of determining how much a vertex can increase its centrality by creating a limited amount of new edges incident to it. We will consider both the undirected and the directed graph cases. In both cases, we first prove that the optimization problem does not admit a polynomial-time approximation scheme (unless P = NP), and then propose a greedy approximation algorithm (with an almost tight approximation ratio), whose performance is then tested on synthetic graphs and real-world networks.},

Homelessness, health care, and crime are all viewed as problems that networks can manage better than single organizations can. This article views these problems as networks that must be confronted if Western democracies wish to deal with terrorism, drug smuggling, and the manifold pathologies that confront failed states. In this article we adopt the perspective of networks as problems.The majority of the literature on networks and collaboration is quite positive. Collaborative networks are seen as appropriate devices to tackle public management problems and successfully coordinate political, social, and economic action. From the level of global governance, European integration, sectoral policy networks at the national level, and service implementation networks at the local level, these devices are all viewed as ways of solving governance problems in a complex and differentiated world. The research proposed here intends to develop a more holistic view of this phenomenon by looking at dark networks. The article tries to evaluate how network structures and governance are used for criminal or immoral ends. Because the judgment of ends is inherently normative, we propose to talk about overt and legal versus covert and illegal networks. We then analyze where the similarities and differences between the two sets are and what we might be able to learn regarding both forms if we mirror them against each other. The article develops a set of propositions drawn from selected cases of drug‐trafficking networks, the diamond and weapons trade, and the Al Qaeda terrorist network.}",

  abstract = {Link prediction is one of the fundamental problems in computational social science. A particularly common means to predict existence of unobserved links is via structural similarity metrics, such as the number of common neighbors; node pairs with higher similarity are thus deemed more likely to be linked. However, a number of applications of link prediction, such as predicting links in gang or terrorist networks, are adversarial, with another party incentivized to minimize its effectiveness by manipulating observed information about the network. We offer a comprehensive algorithmic investigation of the problem of attacking similarity-based link prediction through link deletion, focusing on two broad classes of such approaches, one which uses only local information about target links, and another which uses global network information. While we show several variations of the general problem to be NP-Hard for both local and global metrics, we exhibit a number of well-motivated special cases which are tractable. Additionally, we provide principled and empirically effective algorithms for the intractable cases, in some cases proving worst-case approximation guarantees.},

One of the most commonly-used and successful recommendation algorithms is collaborative filtering, which explores the correlations within user-item interactions to infer user interests and preferences. However, the recommendation quality of collaborative filtering approaches is greatly limited by the data sparsity problem. To alleviate this problem we have previously proposed graph-based algorithms to explore transitive user-item associations. In this paper, we extend the idea of analyzing user-item interactions as graphs and employ link prediction approaches proposed in the recent network modeling literature for making collaborative filtering recommendations. We have adapted a wide range of linkage measures for making recommendations. Our preliminary experimental results based on a book recommendation dataset show that some of these measures achieved significantly better performance than standard collaborative filtering algorithms.},

Here exponential time means 2δn for some δ>0. In this paper, assuming that, for k⩾3, k-SAT requires exponential time complexity, we show that the complexity of k-SAT increases as k increases. More precisely, for k⩾3, define sk=inf{δ:there exists 2δn algorithm for solving k-SAT}. Define ETH (Exponential-Time Hypothesis) for k-SAT as follows: for k⩾3, sk>0. In this paper, we show that sk is increasing infinitely often assuming ETH for k-SAT. Let s∞ be the limit of sk. We will in fact show that sk⩽(1−d/k)s∞ for some constant d>0. We prove this result by bringing together the ideas of critical clauses and the Sparsification Lemma to reduce the satisfiability of a k-CNF to the satisfiability of a disjunction of 2εnk′-CNFs in fewer variables for some k′⩾k and arbitrarily small ε>0. We also show that such a disjunction can be computed in time 2εn for arbitrarily small ε>0.}
