\ctufitabstractENG{
    This thesis provides an introduction to the topic of covert networks and their analysis, with emphasis on the \HL problem.
    We study the problem with respect to the degree centrality measure and using the framework of parameterized computational
    complexity theory.
    We analyze results on this topic provided in the literature and survey them from the perspective of the parameterized complexity.
    We then bring new results to the domain and visualize both our results and results from other authors in an overviewing graph.
